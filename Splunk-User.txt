1st Module:
===========
Machine Data(everywhere, constantly flowing data being interacted)
structured/unstructured
How Splunk uses it
takes more than 90 % of industry data.
data may be anything(not only generated by webservers)

without Operational Intelligence(take more time)

with Operational Intelligence(using Machine data) minutes
     pinpoint/corelate/alert
Splunk: 
--> Splunk can take any data and added to intelligent searchable index and structured and to 
unstructured data and allowing to extract all sort of insights into ur business.
--> application/security/user behaviour/hardware monitoring/sales 
--> translator to ur machine data master

2nd Module:
===========
Splunk Components( 5 main functions of splunk enterprise and how it makes user machine data available, accessable and usable to everyone in the organization)
Index Data
  Heart of splunk
  index collects data from virtually any soruce and it is important
  index as factory and machine data as raw meterials
  data enters in, they looks up the data how to process it(apache.log)
  when they find the match they labelled the data with soruce type.
  work receives the source type is break the data into single events
  time stamps are identified and normalize to consistant formats
  events are then stored in splunk index where they can be searched
Search & Investigate
  By entering query in splunk search board
  we can find index that contains values across multiple data soruces allowing to
    analyze and run test on the events using splunk search launguage
Add knowledge
  we can add knowledge object to the data
  this allows u to effect how your data is turbited(give classsifiaction,enrichment, normalization and save reports for future purpose)
Monitor & Alert
  splunk can actively monitor all ur infrastrucutre in real time to identify issues, problems and attackes before impacted customers and services.
  we can create alerts to monitor for specific condtions and automatically respond with actions
Report & Analyze
  splunk allows us to collect reports and visaulization into dashboards and empowering 
     groups in organization by giving them information they need oraginzed


Splunk processing components:(3 main)
indexer
  process incoming process machine data storing results in index as events
  As indexser indexes data it create number of files organized in sets of directories by age
    this organization is important for search. 
  When we search the data splunk will open the directory that match the time frame of our search making ur search more efficient
search head
  allows us to use the splunk search launguga to seach index data
  handle search requests from users and distributes the requests to index which perform actually searches on the data
  SH then consildates and enrich the results from the indexers return to users
  tools
    dashboards
    reports
    visualization
Forwarder
  Splunk enterprize instances that consume data and forwarded to indexes for processing
  require minimal resourcces
  little impact on performacne
  reside on the machines where the data originates

webserver --> forwarder installed on server --> sends data to indexers

Deploying and scaling splunk:
  Splunk instance 
  Single instance deployment
     one instance of splunk enterprise handles all functions of splunk
          input
          parsing
          indexing
          Searching
      perfect environment for       
         Proof of concept
         Personal use
         Learning
         Might serve the needs of small, department sized environments

Clustering in multi-instance
Splunk enterprise can be sclable to fit any environment

3rd module:
===========
Installing splunk enterprise
   Software for splunk.com (Free Splunk)
commands:
  ./splunk start --accept-license
  ./splunk stop
  ./splunk restart
  ./splunk help  

linux/windows/mac
Splunk cloud

splunk role --> determine what a user is able to see, do and interact with.
    Administrator (can install apps and create knowledge objects for all users)
    Power (can create and share knowledge objects for users of an app and do realtime searches)
    user (will only see their own knowledge objects and those shared with them)

Admin/Power/User


admin/changeme/Ansrloader1@3
power users created:
   subbukandula/5p1unkbcup

Users can launch and manage apps from our home app.
Search and Reporting app will ship with Splunk enterprise.

4th module:
===========
Getting Data in

Types of data input
   Adding data is done by the admin user for the deployment.

upload
  allows us to upload local files to splunk enterprise instance then only get indexed one
  good for the data that is created one and never gets updated
monitor
  allows us to monitor files directories http events, tcp/udp network ports, data gethering scripts
  located on splunk enterprise instance.
  windows specific events
     event logs
     file system changes
     performance metrics
     network information
forward
  we can receive data from external folders (forwarders installed in web servers)

Data upload input option:
   data upload --> file input --> source type --> locate timestamp --> Host name --> Index(creat new index)
indexes are directories where data is stored.
users store all events in main index allowing to use one index to search all the data
1) having seperate index can make searches faster(multiple indexes).
      Web Data index
      Main index
      Security Index
   eg index=web_data_index fail*
   (limits data amount Splunk searches, returns events only from that index)
   Multiple indexed allow limiting access by user role
   we can control who sees what data
   separate indexed allow custom retention policies

Monitor option:
files and directories --> browse log file and select --continuously monitor/index one
--. whitelist and backlist --> app control --> hotname --> index

Forwarders

Splunk used forwarder/s  to categorize the type of data being indexed
Splunk knows where to break the event, where the time stamp is located and how to automatically create field value pairs using source type
Splunk uses sourcetypes or sourcetype to categorize the type of data being indexded

5th module:
===========
Basic Searching (searching and Reporting Interface):
  --> for searching and analyzing data
  --> used to create knowledge objects
  --> reports
  --> Dashboards
Data Summary
  --> source (file/directory)
  --> soruce types
  --> host (hostname)

Commands that create statistics and visualizations are called the transforming commands
By default search job will remain active for 10 minutes
Shared search job remain active for 7 days
export --> raw/csv/xml/json
search modes
  --> Fast mode (field discovery is disabled in Fast mode)
  --> Smart mode
  --> Verbose mode 
Selecting or zooming into events splunk uses your original search job
when we zoom out, Splunk runs a new search job to return newly selected events

Exploring the events list:
Time stamp in events is based on time zone we set in account

Search everything:
wild cards
  --> fail*
  --> booleans (NOT, OR, AND)  order of evaluation (1.NOT 2.OR 3.AND)
         failed NOT password
  --> exact phrases "failed password"
  --> Escaping characters (use backslash \)
          info="user \"chrisV4\" not in database"


6th Module:
===========
Using Fields
Fields sidebar--> shows all the fields that were extracted at search time
--> selected fields (atmost importance)
         it will appear at the bottom of events
--> interesting fields (we can add to appear this fields in bottom of evetns)
          have values in at least 20% of the events
       a date_wday (a denotes String)
       # date_month (# denotes numeric)
       a dest 4(it contains string values and it contains 4 values)
Clicking on fields
      --> values
      --> count of values
      --> percentage 
Wildcards can be used for fileds search 

Searching fields:(search using fields)
     sourcetype=linux_secure   
     filed names are case sensitive and operators are not.
     =, !=  --> used for numerical or string values
     < <= > >= --> used for numnerical values  

7th module:
===========
Best Practices:
--> Using time limit is the most efficient way( Last 7 days --> good, All Time --> bad)
--> the less date u want to search the faster splunk will be
--> more u tell the search engine the more likely u will get good results.
--> inclusion is better than exclusion in splunk search.
Using Time:
  several pre time selection
  real time search(we can search 10 minutes ago)
  advanced (-30m) -30s -30h d w mon y
  @ time range picker to round down to nearest unit of specified time. 
     (-30m@h runs at 9:37.. search will come from 9:00)
  Time abbreviations tell Splunk what time to search
  Time to search can only be set by the time range picker --> false
Using Indexes
  Indexer(use indexer for specific events)
  seperate indexes
     multiple retention policies
     Faster searches
     Ability to limit access


8th Module:
===========
SPL Fundamentals

Splunk search language(build from 5 components)
   search terms
   Commands --> tells splunk what we want to do with search results
      (computing statistics and formatting)
   Funtions --> explain how we want to show(compute and evaluate results)
   Arguments --> variables that we want to apply to functions
   clauses --> which explains how results grouped and redfined.

eg:  sourcetype=acc* status=200 | stats list(product_name) as "Games Sold" |
 
     sourcetype=acc* status=200   --> search terms
     stats --> command
     list --> function
     product_name --> arguments
     as --> clause
     | --> pipe --> to pass test results

Visual pipeline:
    boolean operators/command modifiers --> orange
    commands --> blue
    command arguments --> green 
    functions --. purple
    ctrl + /  --> moves pipe to new line

limits Explained:
    syntax:
    search command | command/function | command/function

Fields command: (fields --> command)
    include or exclude specific fields from search results.
    useful to limit fields displayed and can make search faster

    sourcetype=access_combined
    | fields status clientip  (results will include only status and clientip in search results)
    | fields - status clientip  (results will exclude only status and clientip in search results)

    Fields extraction is one the most costly parts of searching in splunk
    Field inclusion happends before field extraction and can improve performance
    Field exclustion happens after field extraction only affecting displayed results.

Table command:
      retains searched data in a tabulated format

      sourcetype=access_combined
      | table JESSIONID,product_name,price

Rename command:
     used to rename fields
     
      sourcetype=access_combined
      | table JESSIONID,product_name,price
      | rename JESSTIONID as "User Session"
      price as "purchase price"
      | fields - "User Session" (use renamed name)

      Once renamed, original name is not available to subsequent search commands
      new field names will need to be used further down the pipeline

Dedup command:
     removes events with duplicate values.

     sourcetype=access_combined
     | dedup product_name   (| dedup product_name price)
     | table JESSIONID,product_name,price
     
Sort command:
     Display results in ascending or descending order.   

     sourcetype=access_combined
     | table JESSIONID,product_name,price
     | sort product_name price  

    String data is sorted alphanumberically, numeric data --> numerically
    default is ascending order.
   
       sourcetype=access_combined
     | table JESSIONID,product_name,price
     | sort + product_name price limit=20 (ascending)
    
     limit=20 --> dispays only first 20 results

     sourcetype=access_combined
     | table JESSIONID,product_name,price
     | sort - product_name price   (descending)

  Excluding fields using the Fields Command will benefit performance.--> No

9th Module:
==========
Transforming commands (top/rare/stats commands)
(order search reults into a data table for statistical purposes)

Top command:
   Finds the most common values of a given field in result set

   which vendor solds more products this week
   sourcetype=access_combined
   | top vendor
   top command automatically gives count and percent and limit count to 10 by default

   sourcetype=access_combined
   | top vendor limit=20

   sourcetype=access_combined
   | top vendor limit=0 (gives all results)

   sourcetype=access_combined
   | top vendor product_name limit=20  (top results of vendor and product name)

   top command clauses:
       limit = int
       countfield = string
       percentfield = string
       showcount = True/False
       showperc = True/False
       showother = True/False
       otherstr = string

   sourcetype=access_combined
   | top product_name by vendor limit=20 (show top 20 products sold by vendor)
   countfield="number of sales" showperc="False"

Rare Command:
    Same options as Top command
    Shows least common values of a field set
 
    sourcetype=access_combined
   | rare vendor product_name limit=20 

Stats command:
    count --> returns number of events matching search pattern
    distinct count --> count of unique values
    sum --> returns sum of numeric values
    average(avg) -->  returns average of numneric values
    list --> List values of fields
    values --> Unique values of given fields.

Count funtion:
    sourcetype=vendor_sales
    | stats count       (gives count)

    sourcetype=vendor_sales
    | stats count as "Total sells by vendor"
    by product_name   (gives count by product_name)

    sourcetype=vendor_sales
    | stats count(action) as ActionEvents, count as totalEvents	

Distinct count function:
    Returns the count of unique values in the search results.

    sourcetype=vendor_sales
    | stats distinct_count(product_name) //dc(product_name) 

Sum function:
     Returns the sum of all numeric values in a field
      
     sourcetype=vendor_sales
    | stats sum(price) as "Gross Sales" by product_name

         sourcetype=vendor_sales
    | count as "units sold" stats sum(price) as "Gross Sales" by product_name (count and sum should be same pipe)

Avg funtion:
     Creates an average value for a numeric field

      sourcetype=vendor_sales
    | stats avg(seller_price) as "Avg selling Sales" by product_name

List Function
     list all values for a given field

    sourcetype=vendor_sales
    | stats list(Asset) as "company assests" by Employee

Value function:
     returns unique values for a given field

     sourcetype=vendor_sales
    | stats values(s_hostname) by user_name

10th Module:
============
Reports and Dashboards

Reports:
  save as --> report (report will be created)
  Reports tab in application menu
  we can edit permissions 
  Schedule reports
  bar chart/ statistical table

Visualization:
  to visualize our data in many ways
  visulation tab in search
  save as visaulation as report or dashboard panel

Dashboard:
  collection of reports compiled into single pane of class allowing quick visual access of data 
  are reports gathered together into a single pane of glass
  search --> visualization --> save as dashboard panel --> new --> save
  Dashboards tab in application menu
  TIme range picker will only work on panels with an inline search
  
If a search returns this, you can view the results as a chart --> satistical values
user/power/admin role can create reports
time range picker can be included in report

11th module:
============
Pivot
  allows users(who don't know splunk) to design reports in simpe to user interface with our ever having search strings
  Data models:
    knowledge objects that provide the data structure that drives pivots
    created by admin/power
    data model as framework and pivot as inteface to data
    each data model made of data sets(Smaller collection of data defines for specific purpose, they are represented in tables)
    Settings menu --> Data models --> select pivot to see data sets
  save as pivot as report/dashboard panel
Instant pivot
   application menu
   search --> satistics/visualiztion --> pivot --> save options --> ok
DataSets
   allowing users to access small slice of data can help to gain opeation and intelligence from the data without use search
   DataSets menu
      display the list of dataSets
      explore--> to visualize data in pivot
      datasets help users to find data and get answers faster
   Splunk datasets add on

Adding child data model objects is like the ______ Boolean in the Splunk search language.
AND

12th module:
===========
Lookups(allow to add other fields and values to your events not included in index data)
   We can combine fields from external sources to index with searched events
      CSV files, sripts, geospatial data
      When using a .csv file for Lookups, the first row in the file represents field names
   data used for search might not be available in index
   A lookup is categorized as a dataset
   Two steps to setup a lookup file
      1) define a lookup table
      2) define a lookup 
      optionally configure ur lookup to run automatically
   look up filed values are case sensitive by default

lookup table(to use external csv file, inputlookup --> command)
  settings --> lookup --> add new(lookupup table files) --> search(destination app), choose file, destination name(http_status.csv) --> save --> permissions
  | inputlookup http_status.csv

Define lookup:(create defination for lookup table created)
   settings --> lookup --> add new(lookup definations) --> search,http_status, file-based, https_status.csv --> save

lookup commnad:
   sourcetype=access_combined NOT status=200
   | lookup http_status code as status,  (code field will be mapped to status0
   OUTPUT code as "HTTP Code"  
   description as "HTTP Description"
   OUTPUT --> override existing fields
   OUTPUTNEW --> didn't override existing fields

Automatic lookup:
  settings --> lookups --> add new(automatic lookup)
  code will be mapped to stauts for particular sorucetype

Additional lookup options
  populate lookup table with search results
  defnine lookup based on external script or command 
  Use splunk DB connect app 
  use geospatial lookup to create queries that can be used to generate choropleth map visualizations
  populare events with KV store fields
   
13th Module:
===========
Scheduled Reports and Alerts
Scheduled Reports is reports that run on scheduled intervals and trigger an action each time it runs
  useful to create montly reports, dashboards and automatically send reports to emails

Create Scheduled Reports:
   create report(save as in search)
   schdeule option to schdeule it
   Running concurrent reports, and searches behind them can put a big demand on ur system hardware even if everything configured to the recommended specs
   include a schedule window only if the report doesn't have to start at specific time
   
manage Scheduled Reports:
   settings --> search, reports and alerts
   permissions are particulary important for reports
   before report can be embedded it must first be scheduled
  anyoen with access to web page will be able to see report   

Alert into
  Baed on searches that run on schdeuled intervals or in real time
  alerts trigerred when specific conditions are met
  list in interface
  log events
  send emails
  trigger scripts
  use a webhook
  run a custom alert
  An alert is an action triggered by a saved search

Create alert
  search --> save as --> alert --> permission
  sechduled alert type allows us to set a schdule and time range for the search to be run
  real time alert type will run the search continously in background (more overhead on system performance)
  settings --> alert actions (predefined actions)

Manage Alert
   activity --> triggered alerts
     settings --> alert actions (predefined actions)

14h Module:
Final thoughts
